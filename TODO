# TODO:

* Will implement soon:

1. Introduce correlating student ids with real names and emails into
anonymizer.bash. Now that we need rosters anyway for section mode,
section mode should obviously just use those rosters to anonymize the
student names. We should then add the optional switch to use a roster
to "all" mode only. There are two benefits to this scheme:

a. We don't need the TF to save the roster files.
b. We will have, hopefully, better anonymization, in the sense that
you don't just need to remember 5 random characters.

2. Introduce functions into the script, including a standardized way
of checking errors.

* Hope to implement eventually:

1. Introduce some support for anonymizing student submissions as they
come in. One way to do this is to keep track of when we last fetched
data from WebDAV, and then compare that with the dates of
uploads. Stef notes that I need to add error checking for the
situation where people reupload their file with changes.

2. Port the script to a proper language (Python? OCaml?). This would
help with error checking, etc.

* Probably never going to implement:

1. Implement a command-line option to use MAT to strip the files of
identifying metadata. MAT is only packaged in Debian at the moment, so
this isn't a very portable solution. This is hopeless until MAT is
fixed: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=826101)

2. At present, 2-factor authentication is not supported. (There's a
purported guide available, but I don't think this works with Yale:
http://www.qed42.com/blog/using-curl-webdav-two-factor-authentication)
The workaround is to make sure you have already logged in to
classesv2 and have checked to stay logged in for a day, or to run
this script on Yale campus.
