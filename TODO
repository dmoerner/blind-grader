TODO:

1. Implement a command-line option to use MAT to strip the files of
identifying metadata. MAT is only packaged in Debian at the moment, so
this isn't a very portable solution.

2. At present, 2-factor authentication is not supported. (There's a
purported guide available, but I don't think this works with Yale:
http://www.qed42.com/blog/using-curl-webdav-two-factor-authentication)
The workaround is to make sure you have already logged in to
classesv2 and have checked to stay logged in for a day, or to run
this script on Yale campus.

3. At present, anonymizer.bash downloads and anonymizes the entire
class's assignments. It would be good to implement this for specific
sections or for specific TFs. But there are some implementation difficulties:

a. Unfortunately, this information is not available in the WebDAV
PROPs.

b. You also can't implement it by having the TFs manually download
.zip files of the relevant section's Dropbox. Although you can view
Dropboxes by section, you can only zip up the entire class.

c. You also can't implement it by scraping the information from the
whole class roster xls file - it isn't there at all!

What the user has to do is go to each of their section rosters
individually, and then export each roster one by one. Then we need to
parse each of those roster files and anonymize only those.

To implement this I need to do the following:

i. The actual downloading and anonymization in anonymizer.bash to a
kind of function that takes a list of student ids.

ii. Ask the user if they want to anonymize everything or only section
by section. If the latter, just grab the full list of sids from
PROPFIND. If the former, it's more complex. Basically we need a loop
that keeps asking the TF to upload roster files for sections, and then
parses those roster files only for sids, and then only downloads those
sids into a directory with a name for that section.

iii. Modify the deanonymizer directories to accommodate a section in
the name.
